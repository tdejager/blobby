# Blobby

Server and clients for storing data blobs. 
Can be used for the applications that have to save big data files (png, pointclouds, etc.), and you want a structured way to query them.

## Blobby-server (WIP)

Rust server for saving data blobs and querying them.

## Blobby-py (WIP)

Interfaces for connecting to the server and pushing blobs.
